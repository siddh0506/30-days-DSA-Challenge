367. Valid Perfect Square



Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

Example 1:

Input: num = 16

Output: true

Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.


Code:

class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        long left =1;
        long right =  num;
        while(left <= right){
            long mid = left +(right-left)/2;
            long square = mid * mid;
            if(square==num){
                return true;
            }
            else if (square<num){

                left=mid+1;
            }
            else{
                right = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return  false;
    }
}
