1652. Defuse the Bomb

Hint
You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.

If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous -k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.
As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].

Given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!

 

Example 1:

Input: code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3
Output: [12,10,16,13]
Explanation: Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.

//Code :

class Solution {
    public int[] decrypt(int[] code, int k) {

        int n = code.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];

        if (k == 0)
            return ans;

        int start, end;

        if (k > 0) {
            start = 1;
            end = k;
        } else {
            start = n + k;
            end = n - 1;
            k = -k;
        }

      
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            sum += code[i % n];
        }

        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            ans[i] = sum;

            sum -= code[start % n];
            start++;
            end++;
            sum += code[end % n];
        }

        return ans;
    }
