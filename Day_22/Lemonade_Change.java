/*
860. Lemonade Change

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true

//Code :

    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] bills) {
        int five = 0;

        for(int bill : bills){
            if(bill == 5){
                five ++;
            }
            else if(bill == 10){
                if(five == 0){
                    return false;
                }
                five--;
                ten++;
            }
            else{
                if(ten >0 && five > 0){
                    ten --; 
                    five --;
                }
