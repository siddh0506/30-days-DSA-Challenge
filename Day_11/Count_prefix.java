2255. Count Prefixes of a Given String

Hint
You are given a string array words and a string s, where words[i] and s comprise only of lowercase English letters.

Return the number of strings in words that are a prefix of s.

A prefix of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The strings in words which are a prefix of s = "abc" are:
"a", "ab", and "abc".
Thus the number of strings in words which are a prefix of s is 3.

//code:

class Solution {
    public int countPrefixes(String[] words, String s) {
       int count =0;
       for(String word : words){
        if(s.startsWith(word)){
            count++;
        }
       } 
    return count;
    }
